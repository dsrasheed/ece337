Minimum Amount of Time data_ready must be asserted: 10ns

Must be asserted over two posedges of the clk. Since setup and hold times are neglible, it can be asserted
immediately before the posedge of the clk, and then deasserted immediately after the next posedge of the clk.
This is equivalent to the time of a single clock cycle, 10ns.

Minimum Amount of Time Data Must Remain Valid: 4 clock cycles

When data_ready is asserted, it takes 2 clock cycles for it to get to the output of the synchronizer. Another clock
cycle for the controller to set the signals to configure the datapath module for loading. Then another for the datapath 
module to actually store the sample.
